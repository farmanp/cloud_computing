This structure starts with the fundamentals of virtualization, covering components, types, and use cases. Users then learn to install and configure hypervisors, both Type 1 (bare-metal) and Type 2 (hosted).

The challenges progress to creating and managing virtual machines, configuring networking, storage, and optimizing performance for virtual machines.

As users gain more experience, they delve into automating virtual machine management using configuration management tools like Ansible and Terraform, provisioning, deployment, and utilizing templates and blueprints.

The latter part of the challenges focuses on building a hypervisor from scratch, implementing CPU virtualization, memory virtualization, device emulation, and exploring hypervisor architectures and design patterns.

Users then learn about securing virtual machines, including hardening, isolation, introspection, security monitoring, and handling live migration security concerns.

The final challenge involves setting up a Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI), deploying and managing virtual desktops, implementing user profile management, application delivery, and optimizing VDI performance and scalability.

Throughout the challenges, users will work with various hypervisor software (Xen, ESXi, VirtualBox, VMware Workstation), hypervisor management tools, storage management tools, performance monitoring tools, configuration management tools (Ansible, Terraform), programming languages (C, Rust), virtualization libraries and tools, security tools and utilities, and VDI software (Citrix, VMware Horizon).

This structured approach allows users to gradually build their virtualization knowledge and skills, starting from the fundamentals and progressing to more advanced topics and hands-on development, automation, security, and desktop virtualization challenges.
