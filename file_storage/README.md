This structure starts with the fundamentals of file storage, covering file systems, file organization, metadata, and access methods. Users then learn to perform basic file system operations and manage disk partitions and file systems.

The challenges progress to exploring network file systems like NFS and CIFS/SMB, as well as distributed file systems like GlusterFS and Ceph. Users also learn about file-based storage services offered by cloud providers and how to interact with them using APIs and SDKs.

As users gain more experience, they delve into file system monitoring, maintenance, and backup strategies, ensuring data integrity and availability.

The latter part of the challenges focuses on building file system components from scratch, starting with a simple file system implementation. Users then add advanced features like journaling, crash recovery, snapshots, cloning, and deduplication techniques.

The final challenge involves developing a distributed file system, handling data distribution, replication, consistency, fault tolerance, caching, and load balancing strategies.

Throughout the challenges, users will work with various command-line tools, file system utilities, monitoring tools, backup and recovery tools, programming languages (C, Rust, Go), and distributed systems libraries and tools.

This structured approach allows users to gradually build their file storage knowledge and skills, starting from the fundamentals and progressing to more advanced topics and hands-on development and distributed systems challenges.
