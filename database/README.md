This structure starts with the fundamentals of databases, including data modeling, database types, and database management systems. Users then learn SQL syntax and querying, followed by database design principles and transaction management.

As users progress, they explore performance optimization techniques like indexing and query optimization, and delve into NoSQL databases to understand different data storage models.

The challenges then shift towards building database components from scratch, starting with a simple database system and gradually adding features like replication, sharding, and security measures.

The final challenge involves developing a full-featured database management system by integrating the components built in previous challenges and implementing additional features like query optimization, concurrency control, and administrative tools.

Throughout the challenges, users will work with various database technologies and tools, such as SQL and NoSQL databases, programming languages like C, Java, or Python, and database libraries and utilities.

This structure allows users to gradually build their database knowledge and skills, starting from the basics and progressing towards more advanced topics and hands-on development challenges.
