This structure starts with the fundamentals of DNS, covering its architecture, components, and record types. Users then learn how to perform manual DNS queries and trace the resolution process using command-line tools.

The challenges progress to setting up and configuring a local DNS server, enabling features like zone transfers, caching, recursion, and load balancing. Users also explore DNS security measures, such as DNSSEC and TSIG, and learn how to monitor and troubleshoot DNS issues.

As users gain more experience, they can attempt to build a custom DNS server from scratch, implementing core DNS functionality like resolution, caching, and handling different query types.

The final challenge focuses on integrating and automating DNS services, including automating DNS provisioning and management, integrating DNS with other systems (DHCP, IPAM, etc.), and implementing DNS-based service discovery and load balancing.

Throughout the challenges, users will work with various DNS server software (BIND, Unbound, Dnsmasq), programming languages (C, Go, Python), DNS libraries and tools, as well as automation and integration tools like Ansible and Terraform.

This structured approach allows users to gradually build their DNS knowledge and skills, starting from the fundamentals and progressing to more advanced topics and hands-on development and automation challenges.
