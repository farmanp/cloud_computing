This structure starts with the fundamentals of firewalls, covering their architecture, components, types, and rule/policy concepts. Users then learn to implement packet filtering using tools like iptables and nftables.

The challenges progress to setting up stateful firewalls and exploring Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) features like application control, intrusion prevention, and content inspection. Users also learn to manage and monitor firewalls, including centralized management, log analysis, and reporting.

As users gain more experience, they delve into network segmentation techniques, creating network zones and enforcing traffic policies between them, as well as exploring microsegmentation and software-defined perimeters.

The latter part of the challenges focuses on building firewall components from scratch, starting with a basic packet filter implementation. Users then develop a stateful firewall with connection tracking, application-level filtering, and packet normalization capabilities.

The next challenge involves building a firewall management system, enabling centralized policy management, monitoring, log analysis, reporting, and auditing features.

The final challenge focuses on integrating and automating firewalls, including automating deployment and configuration, integrating with other security systems (IPS, SIEM), and implementing firewall automation using APIs and orchestration tools.

Throughout the challenges, users will work with various firewall software (iptables, nftables, UFW, FirewalLD, OPNsense, pfSense), programming languages (C, Rust, Go, Python, Java), networking libraries, web development frameworks, log analysis tools, automation tools (Ansible, Terraform), and integration tools and APIs.

This structured approach allows users to gradually build their firewall knowledge and skills, starting from the fundamentals and progressing to more advanced topics and hands-on development, management, and automation challenges.
