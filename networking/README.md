This structure starts with the fundamentals of networking, covering the OSI and TCP/IP models, network topologies, components, IP addressing, and subnetting.

The challenges progress to building a small network with switches, routers, DHCP, and DNS servers. Users then explore the TCP/IP protocol suite, analyzing TCP and UDP behavior, using command-line tools, and implementing port forwarding and NAT.

As users gain more experience, they learn to monitor and troubleshoot networks using tools like Wireshark, SNMP, and Nagios. They also implement dynamic routing protocols like OSPF, EIGRP, and BGP, and set up and manage virtual private networks (VPNs) using various protocols.

The challenges then cover wireless networking technologies, including configuring wireless access points, implementing wireless security protocols, and analyzing and optimizing wireless performance.

Users also learn about network security, implementing firewalls, access control lists (ACLs), intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and exploring network segmentation and DMZs.

The latter part of the challenges focuses on developing a custom network protocol, implementing packet encapsulation/decapsulation, and exploring protocol state machines and message exchange patterns.

Finally, users delve into Software-Defined Networking (SDN), setting up SDN controllers, implementing network programmability using SDN APIs, and exploring network function virtualization (NFV).

Throughout the challenges, users will work with various networking hardware and software, including switches, routers, DHCP and DNS servers, NAT software/appliances, monitoring tools (Wireshark, SNMP, Nagios), routing protocol software/appliances, VPN software/appliances, wireless access points and analysis tools, firewall software/appliances, IDS/IPS software/appliances, programming languages (C, Go, Python), networking libraries, SDN controllers (OpenDaylight, ONOS), and SDN APIs and tools.

This structured approach allows users to gradually build their networking knowledge and skills, starting from the fundamentals and progressing to more advanced topics and hands-on development, automation, security, and software-defined networking challenges.
