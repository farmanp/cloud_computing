This structure allows users to start with the fundamentals of block storage and gradually progress through practical exercises involving virtualization, RAID configurations, and logical volume management. As they gain experience, they can transition to building components of block storage from scratch, such as a basic block device abstraction, caching mechanisms, RAID implementation, and storage protocol support.

The challenges are designed to provide a well-rounded learning experience, combining theoretical knowledge with hands-on coding and configuration exercises. Users can follow the challenges sequentially or focus on specific areas of interest, depending on their goals and skill levels.
